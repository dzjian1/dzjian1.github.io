    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website!\nI am Dana Jian, a current Epidemiology and Biostatistics PhD student in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine. My lifelong fascination with scientific discovery and public health has driven my dedication to understanding complex diseases and population genetics. On this website, I offer an overview of my working experience, ongoing research, publications, accomplishments, blogs and future interests.\nDuring my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, I majored in Microbial Biology and minored in statistics. This experience allowed me to build a strong foundation in both biological sciences and quantitative analysis. My hands-on research experience ranged from developing viral detection tools for infectious diseases, testing the efficacy of wastewater treatments and computational analysis at USDA to researching bacteriophage-host interactions and dynamics in urban disease ecology systems to gain insights into virome-microbiome interactions, integrating biostatistics, epidemiology and microbial ecology principles in my work. In my senior year, I completed my honors research thesis: Bacteriopahges as microbial modulators: Interactions and impacts on a dual disease system in Callery Pear. These projects sharpened my technical skills in bioinformatics and biostatistics, solifidying my passion for using quantitative methods to address biological and ecological questions with public health relevance. However, I eventually found myself becoming more drawn to scientific questions pertaining to human and public health.\nNow, as a doctoral student, my research interests span population health and genetic epidemiology. My research interests center on understanding the genetic and environmental interactions that drive health outcomes on both individual and population levels. I have also become recently interested in system dynamics modeling, as it allows for a deep understanding of complex systems by representing the interconnectedness of variables, feedback loops and time delays. This can help unveil complex relationships that we see in the real world.\nIn my free time, I like unwind by practicing yoga, reading, knitting, cooking and playing my flute!\nOn this website, you’ll find an overview of my academic journey, current research projects, blogs and future ambitions. My work is fueled by a commitment to bridging genetics and public health, and I am excited to continue exploring these connections through my doctoral research, as well as exploring other fields over the course of these next few years.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations."

    "text": "Below are 3 main ideas that I particularly resonated with and personally find helpful from Jeff Leek’s book.\n\nJust start writing\n\nAs a junior scientist still figuring out my own workflow process on writing, I always used to think that writing comes last at the end of a research project. However, I am beginning to realize and as Leek points out, it is better to start writing early, even when there have not been substantial results. It helps with thinking and helping one to see the bigger picture of the project. Additionally, having some fleshed out ideas and paragraphs is a much better starting point when you finally get to writing the paper versus a blank slate.\nWhat I aim to do now:\n\nSet up a draft as soon as I have an idea\nMake four decent figures first and then write a story around them\nUse simple words and less jargon (because science is confusing enough)\n\n\nCode/Data should be reproducible and accessible\n\nWhen I first learned programming in my undergrad at UC Berkeley, my documentation and code scripts were admittedly not great. My future self often got confused on what my past self did, with a lack of documentation and messy coding conventions. As I progressed, I got better and now, I would say, that for the most part, an outsider should be able to mostly understand what I’m doing (assuming I’ve documented and explained everything well). In his book, Leek hammers home the importance of making code legible and reproducible.\nNew habits I want to force myself into:\n\nUse GitHub to share my code\nWrite clear comments and documentation\nProvide tidy data sets/codebook/READMEs\n\n\nPeople should be able to understand your research\n\nLeek emphasizes the idea that science should be communicated well and that there is no point if your findings cannot be explained to someone. As a junior PhD student still navigating the learning process, imposter syndrome can be overwhelming at times, especially when reading papers that seem so dense and complex with jargon that it often feels inaccessible. Having clear, straightfoward writing would make it so much easier to share knowledge and help others, especially for those still learning like myself. Practicing such a skill would really useful and help to contribute to a culture where science is just less intimidating and more supportive.\nNew approaches I am thinking of\n\nDon’t use jargon unless absolutely necessary and explain any terms well\nMake plots readable\nPractice explaining research to non-scientists or getting more eyes on my work\nKeeping a personal website with my research and publications"

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nReading How To Be A Modern Scientist was definitely equal parts inspiring, but also mildly intimidating, but I do think it is a very good read and can serve as as a reality check for researchers in academia. I think the big takeaway here is that modern science is not just about getting results, it is about sharing them in meaningful and practical ways that can actually help people by fostering an inclusive environment. As a PhD student still figuring out my own research approach and process, these principles serve as a good reminder and keep me on my toes.\n\n\n\nThe writing process…"
